                        <div>
                            <h4>Can every horse go barefoot?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Yes every horse can go barefoot.
                            </p>
                            <h4>What parts of Ireland do you cover?</h4>
                            <p>I cover all of Ireland.</p>
                            <h4>My horse has navicular, can he go barefoot?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, navicular horse’s do very well barefoot and can go back into full time work once their hooves and internal structure have fully transitioned and strengthened.</p>
                            <h4>My horse needs to be sedated to be trimmed, do you take on problem horse’s?</h4>
                             <p>Yes, First I will asses his hooves to see if pain is the issue with why he does not want to pick up his hooves. Once that is ruled out, I will work with your horse to build trust and understanding and show him that he can trust me and that it is safe to pick up his hooves, without the need for sedation.</p>
                            <h4>Do you hold courses?</h4>
                            <p>Yes I hold one and three day introductory courses for horse owners, as well as intensive courses.</p>
                            <h4>Do you remove horse's shoe's?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, I would advise you to allow me to remove your horse's shoe's. This will allow me to do the initial setup trim to help your horse transition to barefoot in the best way possible for him.</p>
                            <h4>Do you fit and sell hoof boots?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, I can advise on the best boots that will fit your horse's hooves, and measure him to ensure you get the correct fit. I stock easy boot gloves.</p>
